* Add MacrophageGroup act() rules
* MacrophageGroup class
* Make all CellGroup subclasses pass their class name into the constructor
* instead of each defining a classname() method
* Change ::instances() to return a std::map (keyed by compartment) instead of
  a vector
* H.P agent should pass completely through epithelium (not linger inside it)
-------
* Confirm transferStateTo() is properly defined in AgentGroup, then eliminate
  call in TcellGroup & cast in CellGroupSyncTest
* Move CellGroupSyncTest::act() into CellLayer::act()
* Change AgentGroupPackage agent from ENISIAgent to AgentGroup
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in CellGroupSyncTest
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in models
* Epithelial damage (lesion) indicator (?)
