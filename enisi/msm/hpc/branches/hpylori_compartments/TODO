* Create MacrophageGroup class
* H.P agent should pass completely through epithelium (not linger inside it)
* Confirm transferStateTo() is properly defined in AgentGroup, then eliminate
  call in TcellGroup & cast in CellGroupSyncTest
* Move CellGroupSyncTest::act() into CellLayer::act()
* Change AgentGroupPackage agent from ENISIAgent to AgentGroup
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in CellGroupSyncTest
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in models
* Epithelial damage indicator (?)
