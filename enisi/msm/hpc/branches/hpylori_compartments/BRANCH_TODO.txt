* Have setBorder() auto-set the CellGroup's opposite border (A setting B as a
  north border should auto-set B as A's south border)
* H.P agent should pass completely through epithelium (not linger inside it)
* test after movement that DEAD state exists in epithelium, not lumen
* Work on moving cell states between compartments (start with DEAD)
* Create mock subclass for testing cellgroup movement
* SpatialProjectionTest: add DEAD state agent in bounds of rank 0 cellgroup.
  move it outside bounds (so it transfers to rank 1)
* Fix SpatialProjectionTest to actually pass in transfers
* Confirm transferStateTo() is properly defined in AgentGroup, then eliminate call
  in TcellGroup & cast in SpatialProjectionTest
* Move SpatialProjectionTest::act() into CellLayer::act()
* Change AgentGroupPackage agent from ENISIAgent to AgentGroup
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in SpatialProjectionTest
* Eliminate context()/space()/grid() calls in models
* Make compartments fully work
* Create monocyte agents
* Epithelial damage indicator (?)
